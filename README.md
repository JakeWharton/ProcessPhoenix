Process Phoenix
===============

Process Phoenix facilitates restarting your application process.

This should only be used for things like fundamental state changes in your debug builds (e.g.,
changing from staging to production).



Usage
-----

Start the default activity in a new process:
```java
ProcessPhoenix.triggerRebirth(context);
```

Or, if you want to launch with a specific `Intent`:
```java
Intent nextIntent = //...
ProcessPhoenix.triggerRebirth(context, nextIntent);
```



Download
--------

```groovy
compile 'com.jakewharton:process-phoenix:1.1.1'
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].
